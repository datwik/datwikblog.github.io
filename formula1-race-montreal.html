<p>Finally! After 2 years of delays for an <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/canadian-grand-prix-f1-montreal-cancelled-1.6005164">obscure reason</a>, GP Canada in Montreal is back! We can now watch the race not only on TV, but also in person. See the actual cars, listen to the car engine music and share the general excitement about the event. Great part about this year's race is that cars are <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.10-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-all-new-2022-f1-car.4OLg8DrXyzHzdoGrbqp6ye.html">completely new</a>, which adds unpredictability as the teams navigate the new specs.</p>

<img class="img-fluid"  style="max-height:400px;" src="https://assets.datwik.com/blog/img/b16/new_spec.png"><br/></p>
<p>Below is the layman's description about our experience in 2022 Montreal race, hopefully handy for anyone who'd like to visit it next time.</p>
<h3><a name="tickets"></a> Location, tickets, info:</h3>
<p>The official organizer of Montreal F1 race is <a href="https://www.gpcanada.ca/en/">GP Canada</a>. Their tickets are working well at the gates and they are responsive if you email them. There are also numerous other websites that are ready to sell you tickets, not sure how reliable.  </p>
<p>The location of the race is on the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Parc+Jean-Drapeau,+Montr%C3%A9al,+QC+H3C+4G8/@45.5152556,-73.5341359,15.83z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xeef1193da93f50fa!8m2!3d45.5140801!4d-73.5337419">St. Helens island</a> off Montreal, next to the <a href="https://www.laronde.com/larondefr">La Ronde</a> theme park, in the middle of the Parc Jean-Drapeau. When there is no race you can freely walk almost all the area around the track. During the race days its a completely different story. As the race organizers are busy builting the pitwall buildings, grandstand put together and cars being shipped in, the area is enclosed by the fence.  </p>
<p>The primary way to get to the race is the <a href="https://www.stm.info/en/info/networks/metro/jean-drapeau">local metro</a>, unless you have VIP car entry or want to brave it using a bike. There is police and security on the Pont de Iles bridge, especially on race day and the bike route from the Rue Riverside under Victoria bridge is shut down with metal gates. Unless you are prepared to arrive really early in the morning, using car is not a good idea. Parking in the park is practically non-existent, parking around nearby metro stations are fully packed before 11am so buses from your area is generally provide reasonable experience. </p>
<p><small>This path was closed</small><br/>
<img class="img-fluid"  style="max-height:400px;" src="https://assets.datwik.com/blog/img/b16/bike_bridge.png"><br/></p>
<p>With metro it is only one stop away from Montreal downtown <a href="https://www.stm.info/en/info/networks/metro/berri-uqam">Berri</a> or, on the other side of river, <a href="https://www.stm.info/en/info/networks/metro/longueuil-universite-de-sherbrooke-%28zone-b%29">Longueil</a> stations, but can get  busy no matter which direction you start from. Better get the metro tickets ahead of time, as the lineups on the station can get quite long. </p>
<p><small>Lineup on Longueuil station for metro tickets, still two corners to go</small><br/>
<img class="img-fluid"  style="max-height:400px;" src="https://assets.datwik.com/blog/img/b16/stm_ticket_lineup.png"><br/></p>
<p>You have an option to get tickets for one trip, several trips or full weekend unlimited (for Sat, Sun), unloess you want to get the reloadable <a href="https://www.stm.info/en/info/fares/opus-cards-and-other-fare-media/opus-card">OPUS card</a>. You can get these either from metro stations or <a href="https://www.stm.info/en/info/fares/list-authorized-retailers">authorized retailers</a> near you.</p>
<p>Having the transportation sorted out, getting on metro train is not bad (esp from Longueil side). Once out on Parc Jean-Dreapeau station F1 organizers want to get you to the Fan Zone. If you want to get to the gates faster you can completely skip it and go a bit forward, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/45%C2%B030'41.5%22N+73%C2%B032'04.7%22W/@45.5114695,-73.5347733,98m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x13345a9b1f3cc1b7!8m2!3d45.5115146!4d-73.5346403">there is a path</a> next to big open concrete space (<a href="https://www.parcjeandrapeau.com/en/major-projects/espace-67-central-concourse-amphitheatre-event-village-natural-agora-riverside-walkway-montreal/">Espace 67</a> - locals say this was the site of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expo_67">Expo 67</a>) which takes you up to the bridge to the Concord entrance through the parc - much easier and less crowded.</p>
<p><small>Skip these gates and go further...</small><br/>
<img class="img-fluid"  style="max-height:400px;" src="https://assets.datwik.com/blog/img/b16/skip_fanzone.png"><br/></p>
<p><small>... until you get to Espace67, then up the path on the left side</small><br/>
<img class="img-fluid"  style="max-height:400px;" src="https://assets.datwik.com/blog/img/b16/espace67.png"><br/></p>
<p>Here are couple versions of the schedule <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.formula-1-grand-prix-du-canada-2022-timetable.6LL3Tjv830N4iLJDOZTcmQ.html">F1 Official</a> and <a href="https://montrealgrandprix.com/race-schedule/">more informative one</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="day1"></a>  Day 1 - Public track walk:</h4>
<p>This is usually the public pit lane walk day. Everyone is allowed on the track, no tickets required. You can walk around, see how teams are putting together the garages and may see occasional F1 celebrity. This was extremely busy day this year, with crowds so big that we gave up our visit not being able to get metro tickets. Spoiler alert: not much was lost if you have tickets for Sunday! </p>
<h4><a name="day2"></a>  Day 2 - Practice and walk around</h4>
<p>Lovely day to get to the race track, crowds are smaller, easier to get around. Organizers have usually few other races on those days for your entertainment so if you have full weekend tickets you can get on the track and figure out all the area. Highly recommend to walk all the way around the area, which follows the inside of the actual race track - easy, pleasant walk under 1h. There are lots of food trucks for lunch, ice cream, beer and plenty of overpriced F1 merch sporting your favourite team's sponsor logos (</p>
<p>2022 prices in CAD:</p>
<ul>
<li>mugs: $30 </li>
<li>caps: $50</li>
<li>clothing: $70 - $300</li>
</ul>
<p>Food prices are moderately expensive, expect to spend $10 - $30 for one person. Most off-track entertainment is concentrated near the Fan Zone, with the biggest shops, couple big music venues, game areas. Also tucked there a shop with JVTrack shop (slightly more moderate prices), where you could also get vintage (1984) F1 car plate for $5. Shops were also advertising to give the plate for free if you spend $50+, but it was not availble after Friday. There were even couple free giveaways - Monster and non-alcohol Holsten drinks. Cabine washrooms are aplenty throughout the site, there are couple ones in the building (one near the entrance) also between them are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pissoir#/media/File:London_urinal.jpg">open air pissoires per hommes</a> - so choose your adventure.</p>
<p><small>Almost no lineup, you can breeze through especially if you have no backpacks</small><br/>

<p>If you have general area tickets, this is good time to figure out where you want to stand on the race day. Most of the track perimeter makes the cars completely invisible behind the fence and trees. There are stretches of track visible well from the path, especially on the Casino straight side, but you'll want to reserve it really early (some lineup from 5:30am at the gates to be able to put their beach chair in the good spot). Otherwise you can figure out your grandstand seats, sit on your spot and enjoy some support races from the high up.</p>

<p><small>Straight</small><br/>
<img class="img-fluid"  style="max-height:400px;" src="https://assets.datwik.com/blog/img/b16/gen_area2.png"><br/></p>
<p>When the F1 practice starts you can feel everyone's concentration on the track. Even without seeing the cars, their sound passing in the distance is engine sound is loud and exhilirating - audibly different from all the other engine sounds you heard. By now you likely learned all the updated team <a href="https://www.goodwood.com/grr/race/modern/2022/1/2022-f1-cars-launches-liveries/">car liveries</a>, this is good time to brush up on driver camera colors. If you are sitting up on the grandstands, it's very hard to see car numbers - but camera colors (usually black and yellow) can tell which driver is passing in front of you. The other option is using binoculars, mostly convenient to see the positions on the giant screen (too tiny otherwise). </p>
<p><small>Grandstands are full for the first practice!</small><br/>
<img class="img-fluid"  style="max-height:400px;" src="https://assets.datwik.com/blog/img/b16/grandstand_view.png"><br/></p>
<p>There are at least two possible pedestrian exits available for you (not counting the Casino bus #777) - through the same gate on the bridge and the Fan zone. Knowing both will come handy on the race day, as the crowds will be huge (this year's estimate was 150,000 people).</p>
<h4><a name="day3"></a>  Day 3 - Rainy Quali day</h4>
<p>This year it was rainy, adding zest to the event (of course everyone wished that rain was delayed to Sunday, alas Sunday was an almost perfect weather). Grab some ponchos from nearby department store and be prepared to hit some mud on the way. One of the cars hit the wall (lightly, backed up and drove away), another slid on the grass - crowd got super excited! Got even a red flag in one of the sectors, aaand Max is on pole again.  </p>
<p><small>Cars on wet tires - bring it on!</small><br/>
<img class="img-fluid"  style="max-height:400px;" src="https://assets.datwik.com/blog/img/b16/wet_quali.png"><br/></p>
<p><small>Albon hits the wall in front of us! I did not realise that <a href="https://f1chronicle.com/formula-1-car-to-reverse/">F1 car has a reverse gear</a></small><br/>
<img class="img-fluid"  style="max-height:400px;" src="https://assets.datwik.com/blog/img/b16/the_wall.png"><br/></p>
<h4><a name="day4"></a>  Day 4 - Race day!</h4>
<p>The day we all waited for 3 years! Beatiful weather in Montreal, not a hint of rain (sigh), slight wind and lots of sun. In the post-(INAUDIBLE) era seeing so much people concentrated in one place feels somewhat unreal. Everyone is smiling, happy, dressed in the team colors (lots of Ferrari fans!) and talking about F1! </p>
<p>The distance that you covered on Friday in 15 minutes, will now take you at least an hour around 11am. Lineups are so long, they start outside of the bridge - 300m away from the gate.</p>
<p><small>You face this after waiting for half an hour</small><br/>
<img class="img-fluid"  style="max-height:400px;" src="https://assets.datwik.com/blog/img/b16/sunday_lineup.png"><br/></p>
<p>Once at the gate getting through security is pretty fast, and the less you have on you the better. Recommended way is without backpacks or coolers, certainly hard to avoid them if you are with the family. Regarless of what you may think, unless your kids are F1 geek gearheads they will be royally bored with the experience. Fortunately kids tickets under 15yo are free. From their point of view is an endless waiting, walking, seeing some noisy cars wheering in the distance. Small consolation is getting free freezies at the kids area, some (wet) inflatables after lineup and walk in the park behind casino (interesting part to explore btw). Fanzone is 20min walk in crowd from Family grandstand - so they likely won't be very interested.</p>
<p>Drivers parade goes ahead, everyone stands for "Oh Canada" and the race starts! Not super exciting this time around - couple of safety cars . Details you can watch on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeQCRKXiRpo">Youtube</a>, <a href="https://f1tv.formula1.com/">F1 TV</a> or listen in podcasts such as <a href="https://www.f1.cool/">Shift F1</a> or <a href="https://wtf1.com/">WTF1</a>. </p>

<img class="img-fluid"  style="max-height:400px;" src="https://assets.datwik.com/blog/img/b16/tsunoda_safety.png"><br/></p>
<p>Near the end of the race you are facing a choice. If you want to get home quicker, better to exit the site half an hour earlier - you'll avoid the crowds in several part of the track and in front of subway station.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you have few hours to spare, then stay in place. Few minutes after the races is over, safety cars passes through and marshalls start to pack up, people begin to crawl on track through the small flag holes in the fence near the grandstand stairs. </p>

<img class="img-fluid"  style="max-height:400px;" src="https://assets.datwik.com/blog/img/b16/people_safety_exit.png"><br/></p>
<p>Not sure if this happens every time (Edit on Jun 29, 2022: knowledgeable folks from <a href="https://www.f1.cool/?offset=1657101720479">Shift + F1 confirm</a> (38:00) that this pretty common), however the secondary fences were down few minutes later crowds poured through the openings between concrete walls of the track. It is a great experience to walk the track all the way to the starting grid and pit stops, seeing all the equipment, safety walls and Tsunoda's car being driven away through the crowd (there were parts of it left on the track for the fans to pick up). Grid and pits area is epsecially packed, everyone trying to take the photo of teams packing up and selfying under the lights.</p>

<img class="img-fluid"  style="max-height:400px;" src="https://assets.datwik.com/blog/img/b16/alpha_t_car.png"><br/></p>
<p><small>Can you walk at 300km/h speed?</small><br/>
<img class="img-fluid"  style="max-height:400px;" src="https://assets.datwik.com/blog/img/b16/open_walk.png"><br/></p>
<p><small>These are some kerbs, eh?</small><br/>
<img class="img-fluid"  style="max-height:400px;" src="https://assets.datwik.com/blog/img/b16/kerbs.png"><br/></p>
<p><small>Lights off!</small><br/>
<img class="img-fluid"  style="max-height:400px;" src="https://assets.datwik.com/blog/img/b16/lights_off.png"><br/></p>
<p>It is unclear if the fence is removed in all the parts of the track, but it's certainly easier to walk on track rather than narrower pathway outside it. Taking a bit of a gamble, you exit at the first opening and hit the giant gridlock near the casino (probably was woth walking further, to exit closer to the fan zone). Spending 40mins on this lineup, next one awaits in front of subway. Security folks inside are really good, letting people in in block enough to fill train in each direction. Another 30mins or so is lost waiting to get in and then it's an easy stop to your next station. </p>
<p><small>The last lineup of the day, I promise you</small><br/>
