                <p>How do you make decisions about buying a milk? Well you don't, you just go to the nearby grocery store, brave through all the aisles trying to distract you from your destination by offering chips, sauce and ready to eat burgers to the fridge in the far end of the store. And then there is also trip back to checkout - more aisles, more distractions, more decisions. But you just went out to buy milk,  why should it be so complicated? :-)</p>
<p>Now imagine you want to buy electronics or open an account. If you want it fast, you go to nearby box store or branch, talk to the rep and they will happily take your money or signature faster than you finish reading your morning emails. We are creatures of habit, location is one of the main deciding factors for us, so businesses are spending millions of dollars to build in the neighborhood at the convenient distance from the potential customers.</p>
<p>If you have a little more time, you may dig into online forums, ask few friends, visit review sites. It all takes time, effort. And most importantly our reach is limited - we can only read so many posts or discuss with so many friends before you either get impatient or tired.</p>
<p>Imagine there was a single place, where you could see a list of all possible options available in the market, validated by dozens of people to be correct so you can make not just informed, but well informed choice.</p>
<p>There are at several avenues already available to you in the online world. Search engine maps provide you with hundreds of reviews for a given location. It's excellent, when you have specific place in mind, want to know how people feel about it and have time to scroll and read through all the text.</p>
<p>Then there are forums. A technology from 90-s, still popular and more recently transformed into FB/LinkedIn groups and or Twitter discussions. Plenty of content, requires enormous amount of energy to parse through. Operating search at times requires having CS degree in data processing.</p>
<p>Lastly there are expert reviews in blogs or online magazines. Amazing people, producing hours upon hours of content. Apart from spending time to parse through all this content, it also requires preliminary research to find out who are actual experts in the particular field you are interest in. Proliferation of paid content also does not help here, at times influencing the breadth and quality of advice.</p>
<p>Everyone of us has experience in our local area both  geographical and in terms of certain products. Pool or knowledge</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>examples where this can be useful</li>
<li>roadmap</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps this is my nature of a geek, trying to organize stuff into folders. Also over time somehow it feels that really useful information is getting harder to find on search engines.</p>
<p>If you are one of those people who enjoys doing some research before buying relatively costly items (say over $100) you may relate to this. I was looking to find a wheelbarrow for backyard project. After looking for some time in the offerings in the local hardware store, I figured I'll need something sturdier - as they call it contractor version. </p>
<p>After some more digging, I narrowed down on two models, that I wanted to get. The trouble was if I plain searched for it, three were only couple stores that carried that item, and they were sold out. Only after digging through forums and asking around, I found another store that not only had the wheelbarrow model I wanted, but also delivered it fully assembled to my doorstep.</p>
<p>Isn't it funny that as a customer, knowing what I want and willing to pay full price, it takes so much effort to actually find merchant that actually carries your merchandise?</p>
<p>I understand, we are in covid times, everyone renovates their houses - so building supply shortages are real. And I think this highlights another issue with centrally managed search engines or websites: they will only show you stuff that is paid for.</p>
<p>Being a huge fan of social knowledge creating websites like wikipedia and stack overflow I grew amazed how large group of seemingly unconnected people are able to amass so much useful knowledge. Along with multitude of forums, social websites like reddit, Facebook etc they contain information of various level of structure and searchability. </p>
<p>I feel there is one more level of structure and specificity is missing - ability to create and maintain as a community a concise list of </p>
